  What is React:
    1. JavaScript library to build Dynamic and interactive user interfaces
    2. Developed at Facebook in 2011.
    3. Currently most widely used JS library for front-end development.
    4. Used to create single page application (page does not re-load).



  Working of DOM:
    1. Browser takes HTML and create DOM.
    2. JS helps us modify DOM based on user actions or events.
    3. In big applications, Working with DOM becomes complicated.


  Problems with JS:
    1. React has a simpler mental model
    2. JS is cumbersome
    3. JS is Error-prone
    4. JS is Hard to maintain


  Working of React:
    1. No need to worry about querying and updating DOM elements.
    2. React creates a web page with small and reusable components
    3. React will take care of creating and updating DOM elements.
    4. IT saves a lot of time, cheezein aasan hai, pahele se likhi hui hain

  

  JS VS React:
    1. JS is imperative: You define steps to reach your desired
    state.
    2. React is Declarative: You define the target UI state and then
    react figures out how to reach that state


  Introduction to Components:
    Components help us write reusable, modular and better organized code.  
    React application is a tree of components with App Component as the root bringing everything together. 



  Create a React App:
    Official tool is CRA(Create React APP).
      • npm: You need to install a package first (using npm install) before you can use it.
      • npx: You can directly run a package without installing it, using npx <package-name>


  
  Create a React App(Using Vite):
    1. Vite is a modern tool to create React Project.
    2. Vite produces Quick and Small bundle size.
    1. Vite is a modern tool to create React Project.
    2. Vite produces Quick and Small bundle size.

  
  
  Project Structure
    1. node_modules/ has all the installed node packages
    2. public/ Directory: Contains static files that don't change.
    3. src/ Directory: Main folder for the React code.
      1. components/: Reusable parts of the UI, like buttons or headers.
      2. assets/: Images, fonts, and other static files.
    3. styles/: CSS or stylesheets.
    4. package.json contains information about this project
    like name, version, dependencies on other react packages.
    5. vite.config.js contains vite config.



  File Extensions:
    .JS
      • Stands for JavaScript
      • Contains regular JavaScript code
      • Used for general logic and components
    .JSX
      • Stands for JavaScript XML
      • Combines JavaScript with HTML-like tags
      • Makes it easier to design UI components


    1. Definition: JSX determines how the UI will look wherever the component is used.
    2. Not HTML: Though it resembles HTML, you're actually writing JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.
    3. Conversion: JSX gets converted to regular JavaScript.
    4. Babeljs.io/repl is a tool that allows you to see how JSX is transformed into JavaScript.


  CLass vs Function Components:
    Class Components
      • Stateful: Can manage state.
      • Lifecycle: Access to lifecycle methods.
      • Verbose: More boilerplate code.
      • Not Preferred anymore. 
    Functional Components
      • Initially stateless.
      • Can use Hooks for state and effects.
      • Simpler and more concise.
      • More Popular.



  Exporting/Importing components:
    1. Enables the use of a component in other parts.
    2. Default Export: Allows exporting a single component as the default from a module.
    3. Named Export: Allows exporting multiple items from a module.
    4. Importing: To use an exported component, you need to import it in the destination file using import syntax.



  Important points:
    1. Naming: Must be capitalized; lowercase for default HTML.
    2. HTML: Unlike vanilla JS where you can't directly write HTML, in React, you can embed HTML-like syntax using
    JSX.
    3. CSS: In React, CSS can be directly imported into component files, allowing for modular and component-specific styling.



  Dynamic Component:
    1. Dynamic Content: JSX allows the creation of dynamic and interactive UI components.
    2. JavaScript Expressions: Using {}, we can embed any JS expression directly within JSX. This includes
    variables, function calls, and more.



  Reusable Components:
    1. Modularity: Components are modular, allowing for easy reuse across different parts of an application.
    2. Consistency: Reusing components ensures UI consistency and reduces the chance of discrepancies.
    3. Efficiency: Reduces development time and effort by avoiding duplication of code.
    4. Maintainability: Changes made to a reused component reflect everywhere it's used, simplifying updates and bug fixes.


  Passing Data via Props:
    Props in React
      •Short for properties
      •Mechanism for passing data.
      •Read-only by default
    Usage
      •Pass data from parent to child component.
      •Makes components reusable.
      •Defined as attributes in JSX.
    Key Points
      •Data flows one-way (downwards).
      •Props are immutable.
      •Used for communication between components.
    Examples
      <Header title="My App" />



  Using Props:
    1. Purpose: Parameters (props) are used to pass data from a parent
    component to a child component in React.
    2. Access: In a component, you access these parameters via props.
    3. Dynamic Content: Props allow components to render dynamic content based on the passed data.


  What is Bootstrap:
    1. Responsive: Mobile-first design for all device
    sizes.
    2. Components: Pre-styled elements like buttons
    and navbars.
    3. Customizable: Modify default styles as needed.
    4. Cross-Browser: Consistent look across browsers.
    5. Open-Source: Free with community support.

      spinner-border

  25. Using Progress-Bar:
      

  28. Using Form & Form-Control:
      The form-control class is a fundamental part of Bootstrap's form styling. It's applied to form input elements to give them a consistent, styled appearance across different browsers and devices.

  Bootstrap: Classes to be used:
      container:
        ● Creates a responsive fixed-width container
        ● Centers the content and provides padding on the sides
        ●
      form-label:

        ● Typically adds some bottom margin and makes the text
        bold
      form-control:
        ● Styles form inputs and textareas
        ● Provides full-width, rounded corners, and consistent
        padding
        ● Adds focus styles and hover effects
      form-select:
        ● Styles select dropdowns
        ● Similar to form-control but with a custom dropdown arrow
      form-check:
        ● Container class for custom radio buttons and checkboxes
        ● Provides proper spacing and alignment
      form-check-input:
        ● Styles the actual input for radio buttons and checkboxes
        ● Works with the form-check class to create custom-styled inputs
      form-check-label:
        ● Styles labels for radio buttons and checkboxes
        ● Provides proper alignment with the custom inputs


  Including Lucide React:
    npm install lucide-react
        go to the icon, copy the code from there and paste it into the component in which you want to show that icon.


  Using Lucide Props:
    To customize the appearance of an icon , you can paas custom properties as props directly to the component.
    <Camera size={40} color={red}>
      

  Using Lucide Lab:
      npm install @lucide/lab



  Fragments
    1. What?
    Allows grouping of multiple elements without extra DOM nodes.
    2. Why?
      • Return multiple elements without a wrapping parent.
      • Cleaner DOM and consistent styling.
    3. How? Two syntaxes:
      1. <React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>
      2. Short: <>...</>

      
  Map Method:
      1. Purpose: Render lists from array data.
      2. JSX Elements: Transform array items into JSX.
      3. Inline Rendering: Directly inside JSX
        {
        items.map(item =>
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)
        }
      4. Key Prop: Assign unique key for optimized
      re-renders.
      <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>



  Conditional Rendering:
    Conditional Rendering
      • Displaying content based on certain conditions.
      • Allows for dynamic user interfaces.
    Methods
      • If-else statements: Choose between two blocks of content.
      • Ternary operators: Quick way to choose between two options.
      • Logical operators: Useful for rendering content when a condition is true.
    Benefits
      • Enhances user experience.
      • Reduces unnecessary rendering.
      • Makes apps more interactive and responsive.


  Handling Events:
      1. React events use camelCase, e.g., onClick.
      2. Uses synthetic events, not direct browser events.
      3. Event handlers can be functions or arrow functions.
      4. Use onChange for controlled form inputs.
      5. Avoid inline arrow functions in JSX for performance.


  CSS Modules:
      1. Localized class names to avoid global conflicts.
      2. Styles are scoped to individual components.
      3. Helps in creating component-specific styles.
      4. Automatically generates unique class names.
      5. Promotes modular and maintainable CSS.
      6. Can use alongside global CSS when needed.


  Passing Children:
      1. children is a special prop for passing elements into components.
      2. Used for flexible and reusable component designs.
      3. Common in layout or container components.
      4. Accessed with props.children.
      5. Can be any content: strings, numbers, JSX, or components.
      6. Enhances component composability and reusability.



  Passing Functions via Props:
      1. Pass dynamic behaviour between components.
      2. Enables upward communication from child to parent.
      3. Commonly used for event handling.
      4. Parent defines a function, child invokes it.
      5. Enhances component interactivity.
      6. Example:
      <Button onClick={handleClick} />
